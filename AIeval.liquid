    <h1>AI Tool Evaluation</h1>
    <p>For this assignment, I utilized an AI tool to assist in the development of an Eleventy-based website that incorporates Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, and data fetching from JSONPlaceholder. The AI provided structured guidance and code snippets that streamlined the setup process.</p>
    <p>Comparing different LLM models, I found that some responses were more detailed than others, particularly in handling Eleventy’s configuration and the proper syntax for Liquid templates. The AI effectively generated reusable code blocks, but some minor adjustments were needed to align with the project’s requirements.</p>
    <p>Overall, AI assistance was helpful in accelerating the project’s development, reducing setup errors, and improving efficiency in handling JSON data with Alpine.js.</p>
