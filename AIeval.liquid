    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">For this lab assignment and previous ones I have found the effectiveness of AI tools to be extremely handy. Not only in this lab, but in previous ones as well I have used chat GTP to help me determine uses with my code, meanings of bugs and warnings from my code, and even cool design features that are possible for my websites. For this assignment I used the Copilot feature given to us in Codespaces just to mess around with it and see its capabilities. While I did like it, I think it is notable that this form of LLM is good for small fixes and changes in code that already exist. I think it is helpful for making tweaks to background colors, fonts, even helping put information into div containers for separation purposes.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">With all that I do not think this method is best for helping develop long lengths of code or starting new projects. I have used the same Chat GPT on my browsers and I feel that I have more freedom to see the code itself be built and described to me when I am on that platform. I have also noticed that with the web browser version, when I ask chat GPT to change let's say the color of the font across the website, it will edit each and every page of my website to ensure that each page has been modified. I also have the ability to watch this happen first hand. With the upgraded version of Chat GPT on my browser I am able to upload pictures as well in order to show things I do not like on my website, or even to show it when my code looks like now and how to update that. Another feature allows me to ask what my website would look like if I used this code and it will give me an example of the page layout and colors. This could save me a lot of time if it is not the desired design or setup. I think you can have all of the benefits of doing it on the Copilot and more when you use the web browser.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">When I tried to use another LLM, I ran into some other issues. This time I used the web browser version of Microsoft Copilot. While it was able to do the things I asked it to such as incorporating TailwindCSS and making changes to existing code, I still found it lacked the features that I loved about Chat GPT 4.0 on the web browser. I also think this has a lot to do with the fact that I pay for Chat GPT and I use it quite often so I have grown to learn a lot about its capabilities and where it falls short.</p>
